// This file will be populated with the result of read_url_content in the next step. 
// For now, I'm setting this as a placeholder or better yet, I should wait for read_url_content return before writing.
// However, since I need to be parallel/efficient, I can't pipe directly.
// I will skip this write for now and do it in the next turn once I have the content.
// Actually, I can't start a write without content. I will remove this tool call from this turn.
